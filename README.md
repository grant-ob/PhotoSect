Steps to compile:
	- In <webapp>, run compile.sh or compile.bat to create the class file for PhotoSectServer
	- In <src>, run compile.sh or compile.bat to create the class files for the servlets in the correct folder

Steps to run:
	- run run.bat or run.sh in <webapp> to start the server
	- visit http://localhost:4004/ OR run run.bat or run.sh in <src>
	- While the application has been tested extensively and is working in Windows and Linux, we recommend using it in a Windows environment
	- To ensure best viewing experience, use the latest stable version of Firefox or Chrome to view the application 

Accessing Features:
	-from localhost:4004, one can access "login", "register", "about" and "browse" from the top menu. The msot recently added images appear at the bottom of the page
	
Account Creation:
	-choose "register" from the home page
	-enter a username and password following the instructions on the right of the page
	-if the username is avilable and valid and the password is valid, the account will be created, otherwise you will have to try again
	
Logging In:
	-choose "login" from the homepage
	-enter your credentials
	-when you are logged in, you are taken directly to the "myphotos" section, where you will see all the images you have uploaded

Uploading an image:
	-from the "myphotos" section, scroll down to the upload section. click "choose file" and then select the image you want to upload. The application will	prevent you from uploading a file that is not an image
	-select "upload"; if it is successful you will see a popup window saying that it is successful

Tagging an image:
	-note: users can only tag images which they uploaded, not the images of other users. This is to limit inappropriate tagging
	-open the image you wish to tag by clicking on it from the "myphotos" section
	-below the image and to the right, select the tag you wish to add to the image and click "Tag Photo". You may add as many tags to any image as you wish, but keep them relevant

Commenting on an image:
	-when you are signed in, you can comment on any image you wish by entering your comment on that image's view page and click "Post Comment!"
	-if you are not signed in you cannot comment, you can only view others' comments
	
Sharing an image:
	-at the bottom left of any image page, click "Share with friends!" to initiate your default mail client. The body of the email will automatically include the url of your current page
	
Reporting an image:
	-if you think an image is overtly offensive or illegal, click "Report offensive image here" at the bottom left of any image page to create an email to PhotoSect with the inappropriate image URL included automatically
	
Deleting an image:
	-You can delete an image by selecting "Delete Photo" that appears below the image. Note, however, this button will only appear if you are the original uploader of the image
	
Tweeting about an image:
	-To share an image or your thoughts about PhotoSect through Twitter, simply click the "Tweet" button below the image to launch a twitter interface from which you can tweet
	-Note, as this is currently being hosted locally, the URL will not appear automatically in your tweet. In the future when PhotoSect is online, this feature will be automatically enabled

	-you can browse images through several different filters, which are:
		-tags
		-user uploaded
